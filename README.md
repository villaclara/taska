> **Note**
_The solution will not compile until all required types with required members are implemented. For a smoother development experience, we recommend initially declaring all necessary types and creating "stub methods" as follows:_

```csharp
public returnType MethodName(parameters list)
{
    throw new NotImplementedException();
}
```

> _This approach allows you to build and run your project incrementally while implementing each method._
